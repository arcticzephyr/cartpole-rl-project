# CartPole RL Project

This project uses Deep Q-learning to solve the CartPole problem in Gymnasium. I have opted for a neural network with two hidden layers of size 128. The program runs and records a video of every 500th episode. This proved quite a challenging project and the variance of the rewards from each episode seems high on inspection. I have saved some example videos in the repo from running the code on my machine.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: see requirements.txt

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the RL script: `python main.py`
